Tipity - The Highly ADDICTIVE Cryptocurrency

THE NOT SO WHITE 'WHITE PAPER'
Everything you need to know about Tipity

<b>What is Tipity?</b>

Tipity is the missing piece to ‘your’ puzzle. What do we mean by that? Well Tipity is whatever ‘you’ want it to be whenever you need it to be. It’s a tradeable Ethereum based cryptocurrency that can be used to obtain a Ferrari (from someone rich enough to trade with you), a vip token that people need to get in to your private event, club or treehouse, a token you trade with your spouse for ‘once in a lifetime’ favours, an ‘IOU’ or ‘YOU OWE ME’, a reward system…you name it. Tipity is your freedom to trade!

<b>Does Tipity have a Whitepaper?</b>

You already have it.

Check in your printer. If you don’t have a printer head over to the nearest office supplies store and pick up a stack of White Paper.

<b>Are you joking?</b>

No. Our White Paper is your White Paper. Tipity is a blank canvas, it is the cryptocurrency that you want it to be. As stated above it has more uses than anyone can think of and goes up in value the more it is used.


<b>Who runs Tipity?</b>

The CEO.

<b>Who is the CEO?</b>

All of you and none of you. You are in charge of your own Tipity tokens, You govern how they are used and your usage governs their value.

It is the closest Tipity can get to decentralization (we could be wrong but that’s what we think!)

<b>Who created/launched Tipity?</b>

One person (not a coder – in fact the furthest thing from a coder – ‘wishes they were’) that lives in a desert, drinks Camomile Tea in the morning and loves the concept and prospect of living in a cryptographic era (whatever that means!)

<b>Will the creator reserve Tipity for themself?</b>

No. All 88,888,888 Tipity tokens will be on sale at the same time, available to everyone! If there is any Tipity left at the end of the Tipity Token Distribution Sale date. The creator will get to keep them and do what they wish with it (perhaps buy a Ferrari from one of you guys!). Alternatively, re-opening a flash sale is an option.

<b>So, is this an ICO?</b>

Yes and no.

Initial coin offerings (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding which can be a source of capital for startup companies. In an ICO, a percentage of the crowdfunded cryptocurrency is preallocated to investors in the form of “tokens,” in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The remaining percentage is kept by the ICO creators. If the ICO’s funding goal is met and the project launches, the tokens then become functional/useable. BUT….until the ICO is over whatever you have invested is unusable/tied up.

<b>Ok?! So, is Tipity an ICO or not?</b>

Yes and no. – Let us explain.

Yes – because the tokens are purcashed by you (The crowd).

No – because the Tipity is a highly addictive tradeable token, that can be used as soon as you own some!


<b>How is Tipity valued?</b>

The Tipity value comes from your purchase and your usage.

<b>How much is 1 Tipity?</b>

1 Tipity = 0.0001 ETH

0.0001 ETH = 10 – 12 cents (based on the current value of Ethereum)

<b>Why is Tipity currently priced this low?</b>

Entry into the market has been set low to give the token a chance of usage by as many people as possible (not everyone can afford a thousand bucks for one token – me included).

The more that Tipity is used the more likely it is that it will be picked up by Exchanges. If Tipity gets picked up by an exchange give yourself a pat on the back! It can now be interchanged between other Cryptocurrencies!

<b>This whole Tipity token has a comical feel to it. Are you guys really for real?</b>

Yes. Do you think our Ancestors and Cavemen stressed as much as we do today about trading items with one another? NOPE!
Cryptocurrencies and tokens regardless of their mission, name, fancy look and code are essentially an old accounting system that has been used for centuries but heavily improved upon in the way that trades and transactions are transparent and cannot be tampered with. It is this transparent system that gives value to even the most ‘useless’ of tokens. Tipity like many of the other cryptocurrencies out there is about experiencing a Freedom to trade (as close to honesty as possible). It’s happening whether we like it or not. So why not get involved early.

<b>What will the value be after the Tipity Distribution Token Sale?</b>

As stated the value of any cryptocurrency or token is driven by your usage. Its true value will never be zero. On the other hand it’s potential monetary growth has no limit as demonstrated by the very old chart below! If you don’t believe us just spend a night or two looking at CoinMarketCap.
